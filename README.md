# Authentication

This project allowed me to gain knowledge of authentication mechanisms and the implementation of secure user management systems. The combination of ReactJS, Node.js, MySQL, JWT, Postman, and RESTful API provided a solid foundation for building a robust and scalable authentication system.


üí° Key Features:

1Ô∏è‚É£ User Login: Users can securely log in using their unique username and password.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Password Reset: Implemented a reliable password reset mechanism that allows users to reset their password on the basis of their username.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Token-based Authentication: Implemented JWT to generate access tokens upon successful login, granting users access to the resource page.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Secure Resource Page: Users can enjoy a secure experience on the resource page while their access token remains valid.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Logout Functionality: Tokens are automatically invalidated/removed upon logout, ensuring enhanced security.




üîß Technologies Used:


Frontend: ReactJS

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: MySQL

Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

Testing: Postman

APIs: RESTful API
